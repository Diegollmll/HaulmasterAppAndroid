Story 1.1: Basic Authentication
Story Details
As a forklift operator,
I want to log into the app with my username and password,
So that I can access the app features.
MVP Requirements
Login Screen
* Username field
* Password field (masked)
* Simple "Login" button
* Basic error message display
Flow
1. User enters username and password
2. Taps login button
3. App validates with GO Platform
4. On success: proceeds to main screen
5. On failure: shows error message
Error Messages
* "Please enter username and password"
* "Login failed. Please try again."


Key Points
1. Minimal UI - just fields and button
2. Basic error handling
3. Simple API integration with GO Platform
4. Store token in UserDefaults
5. Show loading state during login
Not Included for MVP
* Password recovery
* Remember me
* Complex validation
* Biometrics
* Offline support
* Multi-device handling
* Complex security features
* Advanced error handling
Testing Requirements
1. Successful login flow
2. Basic error display
3. Loading state shows correctly
Next Steps
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Create login screen UI
3. Connect to GO Platform API
4. Test basic flow
5. Add to main navigation
This provides just enough functionality to get users into the app and start testing core features. We can add more sophisticated authentication features in future iterations based on user feedback and needs.

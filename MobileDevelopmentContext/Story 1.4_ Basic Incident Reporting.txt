Story 1.4: Basic Incident Reporting
Story Details
As a forklift operator,
I want to report basic incidents (collisions or near-misses),
So that safety issues can be documented and addressed.
MVP Requirements
Incident Report
* Type selection (collision, near-miss, hazard)
* Basic description field
* Submit to supervisor
* Record time and reporter
Key Points

2. Simple description field
3. Basic submission process
4. Records reporter and time
5. Photo/video uploads[a][b]
6. Detailed incident categories
7. Injury reporting
8. Root cause analysis
9. Notification system for admin
10. Corrective actions tracking
11. Vehicle association
Not Included for MVP
* Location tracking
* Witness statements
* Complex workflows
Testing Requirements
1. Can select incident type
2. Can enter description
3. Submit works correctly
4. Basic error handling
5. Form clears after submission
Next Steps
1. Create incident report UI
2. Connect to GO Platform API

This provides the minimum functionality needed for basic incident reporting while keeping the implementation simple and achievable within the MVP timeline.

It feels like we are on schedule. However, we are getting to mid-February and end of March will come fast. I wanted to make some suggestions on next steps to meet our deadline.

We are pretty advanced now with ERD. We just need to detail one or two user stories for a start, and then we have to move to implementation.

Daniel has already created the entities in GO. The relationships are missing. DanielDaniel, let's meet today to finalize the creation of relationships. I need you to reproduce the bug you had so that I can fix it.

Once all entities and relations are created, we can create a first back office for the application, and we will have a website to navigate the back office and the data. Then it will be good to create some test data. Claude can help with that.

Once the first version of the back office is done, Daniel can start implementing the mobile application, using the back office API, for the first user stories.

It would be good to have the back office and test data ready by the end of this week so that Daniel can start on mobile application development next Monday.

How does this feel to you?

Show options‚Ä¶
Hi everyone, thank you for define this.
Since our domain is forku.app, I think it makes the most sense to keep the package name simple and go with com.forku. Normally, package names follow a reverse domain structure (com.company.appname), but since we already own forku.app, using com.forku aligns well with standard practices and keeps things clean.

Including "intelligence" or "intention" doesn‚Äôt seem necessary unless there's a specific reason for it. If com.forku isn‚Äôt available for some reason, we could consider alternatives like app.forku or forku.android, but keeping it as straightforward as possible would be ideal.

Let me know your thoughts. Thank you!

Yes! I think app.forku would be good because we have it, so maybe com.forku is taken so there is an existing forku.com website.

ERD feels good. I see there was a review call with TatsTats  and NormanNorman , 
If all was validated by them, then you can start on GO

About the ERD though, I see that there is change tracking on some data (date created, modified, created by, modified by etc.) => please don't include this on the model on GO , because we can activate a change tracking feature that does that automatically and more. 

Also, our naming convention for entity names and property names is to use pascal case and no underscores. for example FirstName instead of first_name

However, when you create an entity and entity fields on GO, what you enter is the display names, and that can include spaces. For example "First name" , and is will automatically make the internal name (used for code and DB) as FirstName.

Also, you will see, no need in most cases to create FKs,  they are auto created when you created relations. 

We use Guid PKs for entities.

I think this is all for now, you can start modelling, ask questions if you need. And we can do a first review after you've done a bit just to check all is good !!

Amazing job so far Daniel, keep going ;)

DanielDaniel  Stories 1.1 to 1.4 seem perfect to me this way. Great! Nice to have included also what is not included in MVP, to not lose this info. 

I would not add anything. First is to have all these minimum features implemented, before adding anything else.

You can move to implementation. I am still in the process of correcting the auto-create application feature on GO.

In the meantime, I would suggest that you start creating a first IOS application : the overall architecture of the application with a hello world screen, and with documentation of the application architecture. Of course use AI for this.

Hey Walter AlmeidaWalter DanielDaniel NormanNorman, it seems sensible to start using JIRA for managing development tickets. What do you guys think? Looks like a good time now since development is satrting.

DanielDaniel do you have a JIRA account within CI account already?

For context, this is part of the initiative to create cohesive view of different development projects we have across ecosystem and each's priorities, enabling team of teams to move with agility, flexibility, transparency and alignment.

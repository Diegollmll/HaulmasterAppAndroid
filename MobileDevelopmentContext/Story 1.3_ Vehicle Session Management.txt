Story Details
As a forklift operator,
I want to start and end my vehicle operation sessions,
So that my work time and vehicle usage can be tracked.
MVP Requirements
Session Start
* Start session after passing pre-shift check
* Record start time
* Show active session status
Session End
* End session with single tap
* Record end time
* Clear session status
Key Points
1. Simple session start after pre-shift check
2. Basic session status display
3. One-tap session end
4. Record start/end times
5. Clear active/inactive states
Not Included for MVP
* Break tracking
* Location tracking
* Session history
* Detailed activity logging
* Automatic session timeouts
* Multiple active sessions
* Complex state management
* Performance analytics
Testing Requirements
1. Session starts correctly after pre-shift check
2. Session status displays properly
3. Session ends correctly
4. Basic time tracking works
5. Error handling functions
Next Steps
1. Implement basic session UI
2. Connect to GO Platform API
3. Test session flow
4. Add to main app navigation
5. Test with pre-shift check flow
This provides just enough functionality to track basic vehicle usage while keeping the implementation simple and achievable within the MVP timeline.

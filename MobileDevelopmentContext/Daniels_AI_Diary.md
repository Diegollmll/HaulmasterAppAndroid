Hi DanielDaniel , looks like great stuff.
Although it feels to me that it goes well beyond just finishing a prototype. How is the timing to finish prototype by mid April and then switch to GO ?  The sooner we do the easier it will be

Designing a Scalable Multimedia Entity Model in GO Platform


‚úÖ Task Overview

Main Tasks:

Clarified the best way to model reusable image/multimedia handling across multiple entities (Vehicle, Incident, User, etc.) in GO Platform.

Evaluated options between a polymorphic Multimedia table vs entity-specific tables (VehicleImage, IncidentImage).

Interpreted and summarized Walter's architectural guidance on using base entity + inheritance.

Discussed how to represent inheritance in ERD diagrams.

Initial Complexity: Medium


‚è± Time & Value Analysis

Time spent with AI assistance: ~25 minutes

Estimated traditional development time (reading docs, team clarifications, modeling): ~1.5‚Äì2 hours

Confidence Level: 85%

The estimation is based on standard modeling/design tasks + platform-specific discussion cycles.

Would increase to 95% with full access to GO Platform‚Äôs ERD tooling capabilities and documentation on entity inheritance.


Key Factors in Time Savings:

üß† AI interpreted and summarized team chat replies quickly.

üìò Provided ready-to-use ERD structures and patterns.

‚öô Helped clarify a nuanced architectural choice in real-time.

üõ† Suggested standards and best practices for relational modeling with inheritance.


üîç Process Details

Input/Context:

You‚Äôre working with GO Platform and building entities like Vehicle, Incident, and User‚Äîall of which may need multimedia (photos).

Walter suggested deriving entities from a common Multimedia base.

Solutions Developed:

Settled on using an abstract Multimedia entity with derived entities like VehicleMultimedia, IncidentMultimedia, etc.

Each derived entity will relate to its parent with a 1:N relationship.

Documentation Improvements:

Proposed a clean ERD representation strategy using generalization/specialization.


üéØ Value Delivered

Deliverables Produced:

A validated entity structure pattern for multimedia reuse.

A visual/relational approach to handle inheritance in an ERD.

Quality Improvements:

Improved data model clarity and scalability.

Aligned the implementation with GO Platform‚Äôs strengths in code/backoffice generation.

Unexpected Benefits:

Identified best practices to balance reuse with explicit relationships in a low-code context.

Gained a reusable strategy that can scale across entities with minimal redundancy.


üìö Learning Points

AI Techniques Used:

Summarization of team communication.

Architecture pattern suggestion (Table-per-subclass).

ERD notation translation and visual modeling logic.

Challenges Overcome:

Balancing reuse with platform compatibility.

Interpreting nuanced feedback in a low-code context.

AI Was Effective At:

Modeling, summarizing, structuring.

Speeding up architecture decisions.

AI Could Be Less Effective At:

Platform-specific syntax or tooling limitations without direct access to the GO editor.

Making absolute technical choices without team validation.


üß≠ Next Steps

Remaining Items:

Implement the Multimedia entity and derived entities (VehicleMultimedia, etc.) in GO.

Define clear ERD in your modeling tool.

Begin API/backoffice generation with the structure.

Recommendations for Future Tasks:

Use inheritance modeling when common fields are consistent.

Leverage AI early to propose modeling patterns before implementation.

Use field naming conventions and FK strategies that are platform-friendly (especially in GO).


üí° Optional: Innovative AI Usage Pattern

Using AI as a cross-functional interpreter between technical (entity modelers/devs) and non-technical team feedback (like Walter‚Äôs comments).

Rapid validation of architecture decisions with optional visualization and documentation suggestions.

DanielDaniel , overuse of AI is not good either, you need to find the right balance. If you ask for improvements to AI, it will be never ending or end over-engineered.

We have a working prototype with 26 entities, we now have a data model on GO with 40 entities... 

It is time to stop and build the equivalent of the prototype with GO backend. If you are not starting today, you will never make the deadline of having the prototype migrated to GO by mid-may.

We need to iterate, step by step. No designing up-front the perfect data model to cover everything. Which will never be perfect, of even worth, actually out of scope.

The idea for this week was to implement the existing data model on GO, confirming that this part of the data model is correct, and potentially doing micro-adjustments. But not to re-design it and not adding to it. 

I keep re-enforcing and inviting you to go step by step, but it seems to me that you keep digging deep on step 1 never moving to step 2 :) I am curious of what is motivating you in this direction. I think it is important to understand, to shift mindset. For instance, it does not seems that you worked that way with Norman, to build the prototype. What is different here and now with GO  ?

Yes I understand I removed what is not in the MVP, there are some intermediate entities and the child entities from the Multimedia and the Incident handling so I needed to create them, thats why de number increased but I'm just taking what we have in the logic + the Business handling no more.  In the counter you saw are included the GO entities, so that number involves all entities. The Cheklist has some important fields and logic so I was reviewing the things, the AI was wrong for somethings but is not a problem I know what I have and I just wanted to do a second check for all. I asked something in Slack about simplify some entities if possible. Thank you. I'm ready to generate

I reviewed the entities and what I had cretes are that number and all entities are need for the product we built.

Sub7 ForkU GO Backend Setup & API Exploration Session

Task Overview

Main tasks: Set up Git repository access, explore generated API endpoints, identify authentication/registration endpoints
Initial complexity assessment: Medium (SSH configuration issues, large API surface area to navigate)

Time & Value Analysis

Time spent with AI assistance: ~45 minutes
Estimated traditional development time: ~2 hours
Key factors in time savings: ‚Ä¢ Quick SSH authentication troubleshooting ‚Ä¢ Efficient API endpoint identification in large Swagger documentation ‚Ä¢ Systematic analysis of authentication flow options
Confidence level: 85% on time estimation Missing for higher confidence: Specific organization standards for SSH setup, detailed knowledge of GO Platform authentication configuration requirements

Process Details

Context used: Repository clone error messages, Swagger API documentation
Solutions developed: SSH key authentication fix, authentication endpoint identification
Documentation improvements: Identified all 53 APIs and categorized authentication/user management endpoints

Value Delivered

Concrete deliverables: Successfully cloned repository, identified authentication endpoints
Quality improvements: Clear understanding of API structure for mobile integration
Unexpected benefits: Discovered potential server configuration issue with user registration that needs attention

Learning Points

Notable AI techniques used: Error message analysis, API documentation parsing
Challenges overcome: SSH authentication issues, navigating large API surface
AI was particularly effective at: Identifying patterns in API endpoints, suggesting SSH troubleshooting steps
AI was less effective at: Determining the exact cause of the server-side 500 error without access to server logs

Next Steps

Investigate 500 error with registration endpoint (consult Walter for GO Platform configuration)
Try alternative registration approaches (registerfull endpoint or GOUser API)
Begin implementing authentication flow in mobile app
Map current app user model to GO Platform user model

These steps will establish the foundation for connecting the mobile app to the GO backend, focusing first on the critical user authentication flow.

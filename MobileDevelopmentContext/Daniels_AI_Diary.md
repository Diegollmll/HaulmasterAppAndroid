Walter Almeida, GO Founder
Hi DanielDaniel, I see the details in your Claude chat. I believe you are going way too far : biometric login, offline capabilities etc. This is not minimal functionalities. In minimal , there is no offline capability, no advanced login option etc.

Remember, we are building a MVP. not a final product. All we need is to have an application users can play with. Just play nothing else.

Therefore all should be minimal. Minimal means the user can connect in a simple way. Somehow it would not even need to be fully secured

You have one month left to build a full MVP. It is time to implement. No more specs now. User stories should be very simple. 

This is one of the risks of AI => it gives you so much insight that you might want to go for the full fledge functionalities from the start but this will just kill the project and ... you having to work triple time to achieve everything ;)

Hi DanielDaniel,

For authentication, no need to implement the full flow. You will be using the generated authentication API.

What you will need to find out is how you want to manage the data set on the mobile app side, meaning the whole data graph. 

Tomorrow I should be delivering what is needed to make the auto-create app work, and then you will have all apis available

Sub7 Project Setup & Gradle Configuration Session

1. Task Overview


Main Tasks/Problems Worked On:

Resolved Gradle configuration issues
Fixed Compose compiler version setup
Configured version catalogs properly
Established project structure

Initial Complexity Assessment: High (Due to complex build configuration issues and version catalog dependencies)


2. Time & Value Analysis


Time spent with AI assistance: ~2 hours Estimated traditional development time: ~5-6 hours


Key factors in time savings:

Rapid identification of version catalog issues
Quick iteration on build configuration solutions
Systematic debugging approach
Direct access to correct configuration patterns

Confidence Level: 85%


Missing for higher confidence:

Actual deployment metrics
Real-world testing with team workflows
Performance impact measurements
Cross-device validation

3. Process Details


Context/Input Data Used:

Project build files
Gradle configurations
Version catalogs
SDK locations

Solutions Developed:

Fixed version catalog structure
Implemented correct Compose compiler version access
Established proper project architecture
Set up clean module configuration

Documentation Improvements:

Better organized build files
Clearer version management
Enhanced project structure
Improved build configuration

4. Value Delivered


Concrete Deliverables:

Working Gradle configuration
Properly structured Android project
Functional version catalog
Clean architecture setup

Quality Improvements:

More maintainable build files
Better dependency management
Clearer project structure
Enhanced build performance

Unexpected Benefits:

Discovered better version catalog access pattern
Created reusable configuration approach
Improved understanding of Gradle internals
Enhanced project scalability

5. Learning Points


Notable AI Techniques Used:

Systematic error analysis
Pattern recognition for configurations
Build file optimization
Version management strategies

Challenges Overcome:

Complex version catalog issues
Gradle configuration problems
Build file inconsistencies
Module recognition issues

AI Effectiveness:

Very effective: Configuration analysis, error identification, pattern recognition
Less effective: Context-specific optimizations, performance predictions

6. Next Steps


Remaining Items:

Implement Story 1.1 (Authentication)
Create basic UI components
Set up navigation
Implement error handling

Recommendations:

Start with authentication implementation
Focus on core MVP features
Maintain clean architecture
Document configuration decisions

Innovation Pattern


Developed a systematic approach to version catalog configuration that combines:

Direct version catalog access through VersionCatalogsExtension
Explicit version finding and extraction
Type-safe version management
Clear error handling

This pattern helps maintain reliable build configurations while providing better error messages and type safety. The approach can be valuable for other team members working with version catalogs in their own modules.


Key Example:

kotlin

CopycomposeOptions {
    val libs = extensions.getByType<VersionCatalogsExtension>().named("libs")
    val composeVersion = libs.findVersion("compose").get().requiredVersion
    kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = composeVersion
}

This pattern provides:

Better type safety
More explicit error messages
Clearer version resolution
Enhanced maintainability

Next Development Session Focus:

Authentication implementation
Basic UI components
Navigation setup
Error handling structure

Session Summary: Debugging Gradle Kotlin DSL Issues with Version Catalogs


2. Task Overview

Main tasks/problems worked on:
Debugged an Unresolved reference error in build.gradle.kts.
Printed and validated values from the libs.versions.toml file.
Ensured composeOptions could access the correct kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion.
Initial complexity assessment: Medium (Cross-context access in Gradle DSL can be tricky, especially with version catalogs and Compose-specific settings.)

3. Time & Value Analysis


Time spent with AI assistance: ~30 minutes


Estimated traditional development time: ~1.5 - 2 hours


Key factors in time savings:

Quick identification of scope/context issues in Gradle Kotlin DSL.
Code snippets provided for both quick testing and long-term clean solutions.
Clarified Gradle lifecycle nuances that are less obvious without deep documentation dives.

Confidence level in time estimation: 85%

Reasonably confident, as manual debugging would involve trial and error, plus researching documentation.
Confidence could be higher with exact project context (e.g., full build.gradle.kts and settings.gradle.kts visibility).

4. Process Details

Context/input data used:
gradle.properties, local.properties, libs.versions.toml, gradle-wrapper.properties, and partial build.gradle.kts files.
Solutions and approaches developed:
Used extensions.getByType<VersionCatalogsExtension>() for manual access within composeOptions.
Suggested global initialization and function-based approaches for cleaner code.
Code/documentation improvements:
Added a structured printLibs Gradle task for debugging version catalog values.
Recommended alternative approaches to avoid scope issues.

5. Value Delivered

Concrete deliverables produced:
Fixed Gradle build errors related to version catalogs.
Simplified debugging with reusable logging tasks.
Quality improvements achieved:
More maintainable build.gradle.kts with centralized version control using TOML.
Unexpected benefits discovered:
Learned how Gradle's lifecycle affects extension availability within different DSL blocks.

6. Learning Points

Notable AI techniques used:
Quick code snippets for Gradle-specific syntax.
Contextual explanation of scope and lifecycle in Kotlin DSL.
Challenges overcome:
Gradle extensions not being available globally due to initialization order.
Syntax differences when referencing libraries within composeOptions.
Areas where AI was effective:
Debugging and providing concise examples.
Offering clean, scalable solutions (e.g., global libs() function).

7. Next Steps

Remaining items:
Verify that all dependencies build correctly with the adjusted Compose version reference.
Review other DSL blocks (e.g., buildTypes, signingConfigs) to ensure consistent usage of version catalogs.
Recommendations for similar future tasks:
Use the libs() extension function for cleaner, maintainable code.
Leverage AI for quick syntax and scope debugging but verify solutions with Gradle documentation when building production pipelines.

Optional: Innovative AI Usage Patterns

Reused AI to generate both debug tasks and production-ready code snippets within the same session.
Balanced quick fixes with best practices for long-term maintainability.

Story 1.2: Pre-Shift Vehicle Check
Story Details
As a forklift operator,
I want to complete a basic vehicle safety check before starting work,
So that I can ensure the vehicle is safe to operate.
MVP Requirements
Vehicle Selection[a][b]
* Scan QR code to identify vehicle
* Show basic vehicle info (ID, type)
Basic Checklist
* Show simple PASS /[c][d] FAIL questions
* Critical safety items only
* Submit inspection results
* Prevent vehicle use if critical checks fail
Key Points
1. Simple QR code scan for vehicle identification
2. Basic checklist of 5[e][f] critical safety items
3. Simple pass/fail responses
4. Photo capture for issues[g]
5. Basic Time tracking[h][i]
6. Basic submission to GO Platform
Not Included for MVP
* Clear[j] critical item identification
* Offline support
* Complex validations
* Detailed vehicle info
* Check history
* Multiple checklists
* * Location tracking
Testing Requirements
1. QR code scanning works
2. All checklist items can be answered
3. Critical failures prevent vehicle use
4. Basic submission functions
Next Steps
1. Implement QR scanner
2. Create basic checklist UI
3. Connect to GO Platform API
4. Test critical item validation
5. Add to main app flow
This provides the minimum functionality needed to ensure basic safety compliance while keeping the implementation simple and achievable within the MVP timeline. We can add more sophisticated features in future iterations based on user feedback and needs.




[a]Manual selection (in app), as well as check in. In case of QR code failure etc.
[b]Got it
[c]Pass/Fail
[d]goit
[e]Why 5?
[f]Is referring to:
Brakes: Essential for stopping and preventing accidents
Forks: Must be intact to safely carry loads
Tires: Critical for stability and safe movement
Steering: Essential for vehicle control
Hydraulics: Required for safe load handling
[g]Can we include? What's the limitation?
[h]Checklist timer only, right? Still vehicle session and operator session captured?
[i]Should be in MVP:


Basic timestamp when check is submitted
Simple start/end time for tracking when check was performed


Not in MVP:


Detailed time tracking per inspection item
Performance metrics based on inspection duration
Time limits or warnings for inspection length
Analytics about inspection timing patterns
Inspection speed monitoring
[j]What does this mean?
Does the refer to admin unlocking a vehicle restricted after a fail pre-shift check?
Or an admin acknowledging a failure?

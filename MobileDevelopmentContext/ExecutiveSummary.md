EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ForkU (also known as ForkSense or Sub7) is a comprehensive mobile platform designed to revolutionize forklift fleet management for small and medium-sized businesses in Mexico. The application aims to address critical challenges in forklift operations, including safety compliance, operator training, equipment maintenance, and operational efficiency

"The platform serves two primary user types: forklift operators and administrators. For operators, it provides pre-shift vehicle checks, incident reporting, training management, and performance tracking. For administrators, it offers real-time monitoring of operators and equipment, compliance tracking, maintenance scheduling, and analytics.
"

With an affordable subscription model of $5 per driver and $10 per admin monthly, the application targets businesses with 1-7 forklifts that struggle with manual tracking methods. The MVP focuses on essential features including authentication, vehicle checks, session management, incident reporting, and basic compliance tools

By automating administrative tasks, enhancing safety protocols, and improving communication, ForkU aims to reduce accidents, minimize downtime, and increase operational efficiency while ensuring regulatory compliance with standards like NOM-006-STPS-2023.
